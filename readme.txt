This program gets rid of the modal dialog that Google Chrome displays when you run multiple chrome versions side by side.

The modal dialog says this:

Your profile can not be used because it is from a newer version of Google Chrome.
Some features may be unavailable. Please specify a different profile directory or use a newer version of Chrome.

This program just clicks the OK button.
